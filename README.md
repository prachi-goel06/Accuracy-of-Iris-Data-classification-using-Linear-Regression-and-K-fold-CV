# Accuracy-of-Iris-Data-classification-using-Linear-Regression-and-K-fold-CV
For the given Iris data set, our aim is to find the classification accuracy of Linear Regression using K-fold Validation. Depending on the given attributes of the flower the classification method should be able to regress the test data into three classes of IRIS flower i.e. Iris- Setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica using the linear regression on the training set. The validation method used to find the accuracy of this classification is K-fold Cross Validation The value of K should be justifiable for the given set of data.
